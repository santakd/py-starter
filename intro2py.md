## Intro to Python Programming 

#### What is Python? Why Should You Learn It?
Python is a high-level programming language that’s easy to read and write. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1989, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages today!

#### Why Python?
1. Easy to learn (syntax is simple and readable).
2. Versatile (used for web development, data analysis, AI, game development, and more!).
3. Large community support (you’ll never be stuck alone!).

#### Getting Started: 
1. Install Python
2. Download Python from python.org.
3. Install it on your computer.
4. Open the Python IDLE or use a code editor like VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook.

Your First Program: 
“Hello World”!

`print("Hello World!")`

Run this program, and you’ll see “Hello World!” printed on your screen. Congrats, you’re now a Python programmer!

#### Variables and Data Types
Variables are like containers that hold values in Python. 
You can store numbers, text, lists, or even other objects in variables. Let’s explore some basic data types:

 
##### 1. Integers
Whole numbers (e.g., 5, -3).

```
age = 20
print(age)  # Output: 20
```

##### 2. Floats
Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, 2.5).

```
pi = 3.14`
print(pi)  # Output: 3.14
```

##### 3. Strings
Text enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Hello", 'World').

```
name = "Alice"
print(name)  # Output: Alice
```

##### 4. Booleans
Logical values (True or False).

```
is_python_fun = True
print(is_python_fun)  # Output: True
```

##### Tips & Tricks:
Variable names should be descriptive (e.g., my_age, not just a).
Avoid using reserved keywords like if, else, or while as variable names.
